  <p>For more typographic sophistication, you can also turn to the font-variant
    property, which lets you set type as small-caps. In small cap style,
    lowercase letters appear as slightly downsized capital letters, like so:
    <span>pomp</span> and <span>circumstance</span>. WHEREAS THIS IS TRUE CAPS.</p>
