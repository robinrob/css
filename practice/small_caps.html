      For more typographic sophistication, you can also turn to the font-variant
      property, which lets you set type as small-caps. In small cap style,
      lowercase letters appear as slightly downsized capital letters, like so:
      <span>pomp</span>
      and
      <span>circumstance</span>.
    </p>
